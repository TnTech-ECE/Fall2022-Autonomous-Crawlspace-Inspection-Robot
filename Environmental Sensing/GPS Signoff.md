# Function of the subsystem:

The robot will use a GPS subsystem to track its location in real-time, which will help improve environmental data collection. By integrating GPS, the robot can continuously determine its precise coordinates, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of data collection. It can navigate to specific locations based on GPS coordinates, allowing for targeted data collection from different points of interest. This approach enables more precise data gathering.

The team chose the M10Q-5883 GNSS GPS & Compass Module, for the function of real-time location tracking to improve environmental data collection in a robot.

The GPS subsystem works with the top-level controller and robotic operating system (ROS). The controller manages different parts of the robot and can use GPS data along with other sensors to make decisions and control its actions. ROS helps the GPS subsystem connect with other systems like mapping and path planning, making everything work together smoothly.

## Function:
The GPS subsystem helps the robot know exactly where it is at all times. It uses a special module called M10Q-5883 GNSS GPS & Compass to track its location accurately and continuously.

- The GPS subsystem communicates with the top-level controller, providing real-time location data that helps the controller make decisions and control the robot's actions.
- The GPS subsystem integrates with the robotic operating system (ROS), which allows it to seamlessly exchange data with other systems in the robot.
- The GPS subsystem shares its location data with mapping and path planning modules in ROS, enabling the robot to navigate to specific locations for targeted data collection.
- The GPS subsystem collaborates with other sensors, sharing its location data to enhance the robot's ability to gather accurate environmental data by combining information from multiple sources.

# Constraints:
First constraint that we need to considered is the GPS Signal Acquisition. The robot operates in an environment with limited sky visibility, it may struggle to acquire a strong GPS signal, leading to inaccurate or intermittent readings.

Second constraint that we need to considered is accuracy of GPS readings. The accuracy of GPS readings can be quantified using metrics such as horizontal accuracy, vertical accuracy, and time accuracy. 

Third constraint that we need to considered is environmental constraints. Environmental factors, such as signal blockage or degradation, can be modeled using signal propagation models. These models consider factors such as distance, obstacles, and signal attenuation to predict the quality of the GPS signal in a given environment.

# Analysis 

In situations where there are obstacles obstructing the line of sight between the GPS module and the satellites, the limited sky visibility can result in weaker GPS signals and a decrease in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To assess the effect of limited sky visibility on GPS signal quality, one can utilize the Log-normal Shadowing Model. This model considers the distance between the GPS module and the obstacles, allowing for the quantification of signal attenuation caused by the obstacles.
<br>
<br>
The Log-normal Shadowing Model: $P_r = P_t - PL – X$
<br>
<br>
$P_r$ is a received signal power, which represents the strength of the signal received by the M10Q-5883 module. The GPS receiver receives GPS signals at $1575.42$ $MHz$ ($L1$ $frequency$) at a power level of $-125$ $dBm$ (about $0.1$ $fWatt$).
<br>
<br>
$P_t$ is transmitted signal power, which represents the power of the signal transmitted by the satellites. 
<br>
For GPS, total L-band transmit power levels of $50-240 W$, 
<br>
$20-135 W$ for GLONASS
<br>
$95-265 W$ for Galileo,
<br>
$130-185 W$ for BeiDou-2. 
<br>
<br>
The path loss $(PL)$ can be determined using the Friis transmission equation:
$PL = 20log10(d) + 20log10(f) - 147.55$
<br>
Where the $d$ is Distance between the receiver and the satellites = propagation time x radio wave speed
<br>
- Convert the received signal power from $dBm$ to $Watts$: $Ptx = 10^((-125 - 30) / 10) = 0.1$ $fWatt$
- the antenna gains (considering an omnidirectional antenna): $Gtx = Grx = 0$ $dBi$
- $wavelength (λ)$: $λ = c / f = 299,792,458 m/s / (1575.42 MHz) = 0.190293 m$
- Friis transmission equation to find the $distance (d)$ : $d = λ / (4π) * 10^((Ptx - Prx + Gtx + Grx) / 20)$
   $= 0.190293 m / (4π) * 10^((0.1 - (-125) + 0 + 0) / 20)$
   $= 0.190293 m / (4π) * 10^((125.1) / 20)$
   $= 0.190293 m / (4π) * 10^(6.255)$
   $≈ 0.190293 m / (4π) * 1,983,400.66$
<br>

 > "A receiver uses signals from satellites to figure out how long it takes for radio waves to travel from the satellites to the receiver's antenna. The signals sent by the satellites include time information, so the difference between that time and the receiving time is called the propagation time. By multiplying this propagation time by the speed of radio waves (which is the same as the speed of light, approximately 299,792,458 meters per second), we can calculate the distance between the satellites and the receiver."

<br>

$PL = 20log10(d) + 20log10(f) - 147.55$
<br>
$d ≈ 0.190293 m / (4π) * 1,983,400.66$
<br>
$f = 1575.42 MHz$
<br>
$PL = 20log10(0.190293 m / (4π) * 1,983,400.66) + 20log10(1575.42 MHz) - 147.55$
<br>

Calculatiion:
<br>

$20log10(0.190293 m / (4π) * 1,983,400.66)$
<br>
   $≈ 20log10(0.190293 m / (4π) * 1,983,400.66)$
   <br>
   $≈ 20log10(0.190293 m / 7.85398) * 1,983,400.66)$
   <br>
   $≈ 20log10(0.0242102 m * 1,983,400.66)$
   <br>
   $≈ 20log10(48,152.98 m)$
   <br>
   $≈ 20 * log10(48,152.98)$
   <br>
   $≈ 20 * 4.682$
   <br>
   $≈ 93.648$$
<br>

$20log10(1575.42 MHz)$
   <br>
   $≈ 20log10(1575.42 MHz)$
   <br>
   $≈ 20 * log10(1575.42)$
   <br>
   $≈ 20 * 3.197$
    <br>
   $≈ 63.94$
<br>


$PL ≈ 93.648 + 63.94 - 147.55$
<br>
   $≈ 210.588 - 147.55$
   $≈ 63.038$
<br>
The path loss value of 63.038 indicates that the signal strength decreases as the distance between the transmitter and receiver increases. Higher path loss values indicate weaker signal strength. 

<br>
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR):
<br>
The received signal power: -125 dBm
<br>
The noise power bandwidth (2.046 MHz): -110 dBm
<br>
The modulation scheme: 43 dB
<br>
the received power: -135 dBm
<br>
the received power: -147 dBm
<br>
SNR = Pr / N0  (Note that Pr: received signal power and N0: noise power)
<br>
SNR at Received Signal Power: SNR = -125 dBm / -110 dBm = 15 dB
<br>
SNR during Acquisition: SNR = -135 dBm / -110 dBm = 25 dB
<br>
SNR during Tracking: SNR = -147 dBm / -110 dBm = 37 dB

<br>
Higher SNR values indicate a better quality of service and higher resistance to noise and interference.

We are using M10Q-5883 GNSS GPS & Compass Module and this module supports concurrent reception of four GNSS systems: GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou. It is designed to provide exceptional sensitivity and acquisition time for all L1 GNSS signals. The high number of visible satellites (30 for GPS, 24 for GLONASS, 25 for Galileo, and 46 for BeiDou) indicates good satellite availability, which can contribute to improved positioning accuracy. The u-blox Super-S technology enhances RF sensitivity and can improve the dynamic position accuracy in challenging scenarios such as non-line-of-sight environments. The module is equipped with a high-gain 15 x 15 mm² patch antenna, which offers a balance between performance and small size. This omnidirectional antenna radiation pattern provides flexibility in device installation. The GNSS module communicates with the robot's system via UART interface, and the magnetic compass used is the QMC5883L. The power consumption of the module is 13mA, and it operates within a temperature range of -20°C to 80°C. The GNSS module supports the UBX protocol at a default baud rate of 9600, and the NMEA protocol at a 1Hz update rate.
