# Livestream Camera Subsystem
# Function of the subsystem

The purpose of adding a live stream video camera to the Raspberry Pi in an Autonomous Crawl Space Inspection Robot is to establish seamless communication between the robot and a central control unit. This entails transmitting real-time video feeds. By incorporating a live stream camera, the central control unit can remotely monitor and observe the robot's actions and the surrounding environment within the crawl space instantly. This functionality enables efficient inspection and exploration by providing a live video feed that allows operators to assess the crawlspace's condition, identify potential concerns, and make well-informed decisions based on visual feedback. The live stream camera on the Raspberry Pi enhances communication and coordination between the robot and the central control unit, resulting in an improved inspection system that is more responsive and effective.

The team chose the BetaFPV C02 2.1mm 1200TVL FPV Micro Camera. By connecting the camera to Raspberry Pi, the team can utilize the features of the BetaFPV C02 2.1mm 1200TVL FPV Micro Camera. The Raspberry Pi's dedicated camera connector is compatible with the BetaFPV C02. 


# Constraints:

1. Limited bandwidth in the crawlspace area. This can affect the quality and reliability of the live video feed.

2. The latency, which is the delay introduced during real-time video streaming over a network. This delay can impact the responsiveness of the remote control and guidance of the robot.

3. The Raspberry Pi's limited computational power is a constraint. This may affect the camera's ability to handle high-resolution video streams or perform additional image processing tasks. As a result, it could impact the quality and responsiveness of the video feed.

Specifications and Constraints:

- Consider limited bandwidth in the crawlspace, which can affect video quality and reliability.

- Consider the latency in real-time video streaming, impacting remote control responsiveness.

- Understand the Raspberry Pi's limited processing capabilities, affecting high-resolution video handling.



# Analysis

The bandwidth in the crawl space area may affect the quality and reliability of the video feed. The camera has a resolution of 1200TVL, a 1/4" CMOS sensor, and a 2.1mm lens with a FOV of 160°. The resolution is 1200 pixels. The frame rate is 30 fps. Common bit depth of 24 bits (8 bits per channel) and a compression ratio of 10:1

Bandwidth = Resolution × Frame Rate × Bit Depth × Compression Ratio

The bandwidth for streaming real-time video from the BetaFPV C02 camera = 1200 pixels × 30 fps × 24 bits × 10 = 8,640,000 bits per second (bps)

Convert bits per second to megabits per second (Mbps):
Total bits per second = 8,640,000 bps
Total megabits per second (Mbps) = Total bits per second / 1,000,000 = 8,640,000 bps / 1,000,000 = 8.64 Mbps

The C02 camera requires approximately 8.64 Mbps of bandwidth to stream real-time video. Based on the bandwidth of 8.64 Mbps for the video feed, the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, should be able to handle the processing demands in real-time without compromising the quality. The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B is capable of handling high-resolution video streams and can decode H.265 (HEVC) and H.264 (AVC) video codecs. It supports up to 4K video playback. The quad-core ARM Cortex-A72 CPU and VideoCore VI GPU of the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B indicate sufficient processing capabilities.

By comparing the original data size with the compressed data size, the compression ratio is 10:1, which means that the compressed data size is 1/10th of the original data size. The video data can be significantly reduced in size without compromising the quality too much. This allows for more efficient transmission and reduces the bandwidth consumption. “Higher compression ratios may result in a loss of video quality, such as reduced sharpness or increased artifacts.”

The BetaFPV camera is a small and lightweight camera. It has a higher resolution than the minimum requirement for good video quality. It uses the NTSC system, which supports smooth video at around 30 frames per second. The camera is power-efficient, drawing low current at both 3.3V and 5V. It also offers a wide field of view of 160°. Overall, it is an affordable option that meets video quality requirements while being lightweight and power-efficient.
